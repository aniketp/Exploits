Windows Memory Management
=========================
Memory --> Where we can store almost everything and anything. 
Management --> Proper usage of the memory, so that our device can perform fast. Optimising the memory for the better usage.
		temp
		%temp%
		C:\Windows\preftech
		recyclebin
		Defragment Your Disk

There are two type of memories.
1. Primary Memory
	when restrated or shut down, the data inside the memory wipes out. Data which was stored in this type of memory, deletes.
	RAM --> Random Access Memory
2. Secondary Memory
	This type of memory is used for storing data permanently. Whenever I restart or shut down my device, the data inside this storage never wipes out, unless deleted manually.
	HDD, Pen Drive, SSD

Cyber Forensics
===============
These are some standard steps and procedure.
	1. When an evidence is found, directly take it to cyber forensic lab.
	2. Never ever perform the forensic on the original device.
	3. We always make 2-3 cloned copies of the original device.
	4. Use isolation place for performing investigation.
	5. Always maintain a journal for each and every thing
	Sr.No.| Destination | Data You receive| time and Date

Programming Language
--------------------
Program
	Set of instructions and commands which I want my device to perform. I command my device using a program.
Language
	Medium of communication between two entities

1. High Level Programming Language
	This type of programming language use only english and mathematical expressions, and is understandable to human.
	c, c++, java, python, perl, ruby
2. Low Level Programming Language
	This language is used by computers only. This language contains 0 and 1 only ---> Binary Language
3. Mid Level Programming Language
	This type of programming language converts High Level programming Language to low Level programming language. This is something we called assambely language.

file.c ---> file.o|.obj ---> file.exe
