Cryptography
============
I am sending a message which is in plain english when i types it, but when it is being send, it converts into different language. That thing is known as Cryptography.
Plain text ----> Algorithm -----> It converts plain text into another language text, wont be able to read by other users. ---> encryption ----> send ----> trnasmission ----> Alia will receive ----> Encrypted text will be converted into plain text ---> Decryption ----> It will be in plain text. --> readable form.


Cryptographic Algorithm
=======================
Encryption --> Conversion of plain text into encrypted form
Decryption --> Conversion of encrypted text into plain text
Cipher Text --> Converted text --> encrypted text
Algorithm --> Code which is used for encryption and decryption
Key --> It is the function on the basis of which my texts are converted

Ceaser Cipher
-------------
		Satinder ---> Alia Bhat
		Plain Text --> Hello Baby, How Are You?
		Algorithm ---> Ceaser Cipher
		Key ---> 3
		Cipher Text --> Khoor Edeb, Krz duh Brx?
		Tansmit ---> Alia Bhat
		Decryption ---> Key
		Plain Text --> Hello Baby, How Are You?

Steganography
=============
Hiding data in the plain site. User will see only the upper layer. The icon, image, song, video, application. Art oh hiding.

Hashes and Encryption
---------------------
Encryption ----> Reversible process, i have a key and i can convert the cipher text to plain text
Hases --> They are irreversible, once any file or text is hased, it cannot be converted back. 2 words can never have the same hash value.

1. Base 64 encoding
	Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation.

2. MD5 --> Message Digest 512 --> It uses only hex value to convert any string to a MD5, It converts a text into a block of 512 bits. It have a fix length.

RSA and SHA --> Read

Hash Cracking
-------------
hashcat - Fastest hack recovering and cracking tool

hashcat -a 3 -m 0 /root/Desktop/md5.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

	hashcat --> name of the hash recovery tool
	-a --> attack mode
	3 --> Brute force
	-m --> hash type
	0 --> MD5 hashes
	/root/Desktop/md5.txt --> File which is having MD5 Hashes
	/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --> Dictionary for Brute force
	--force --> that i am not using GPU, rather i will use only CPU, so please forcefully start the cracking

Convert .cap file into hxcap extension and you can use hashcat for craking it.
