Introduction To Network Terminologies
-------------------------------------

Social Network ----> Way of communication between peoples..... They go to different places...

Social Places ----> Places where people meet with each other, like public places, Rajiv chowk, Hauz Khas
			Facebook, Orkut, Happen.

Network ----> Connection of two or more devices.... laptops, desktops, mobiles, AC, Printer.... which can communicate with each other and their sole purpose is information interchange





Information ---> Collection of data


Data ---> Raw Material

Let's have a bomb blast in Kashmiri Gate ISBT.

Have ---> kuch krna h
Bomb blast ---> qa krna h   =----> diwali wala ptaka
Kashmiri Gate ----> destination ----> Kashmir photo+gate
ISBT ----> destination ---> Indian South Beta Tango

Topology of Network
-------------------
It is the way in which my devices are connected for communication.
	1. Start Topology
	2. Ring Topology
	3. Mess Topology
	4. Bus Topology
	5. Hybrid Topology


Protocols
---------
Set of rules.... Rules which are necessary for performing some kind of tasks..... 

IP ---> Internet Protocol
HTTP ---> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
FTP --> File Transfer Protocol
SMTP ---> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
TCP --> Transmission Control Protocol
DHCP ---> Dynamic Host Confiduration Protocol
UDP ---> User Datagram Protocol

IP Address
-----------
These are the virtual Address which are provided by the router to our device when we are connected to it. They are unique in the network.

Why Virtual Address???? ---> When we change our network or router.... our IP Address also changes


Version Of IP Address ---->
---------------------------
1. IPv4 ----> It is a 32 bit address. Divided into 4 octects divided by a period
			A.B.C.D
			192.168.0.2
			192 --> 11000000
			168 --> 10101000
			0 ----> 00000000
			2 ----> 00000010
		128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
		1 	1 	0 	0 	0	0	0	0
		1 	0	1 	0	1 	0	0	0
		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
		0	0	0	0	0	0	1 	0

	192.168.0.2 ----> 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000010
	2^32 ---> IP Address

2. IPv6 --> It is a 128 bit address. It uses hexadecimal number as the IP Address....2^128 IP AAddress


Subnetting ----> IP ko divide krna shuru kr do....They started dividing the IP Address as per their series




Internet<----- IP Address <---- Router <----IP Address <------ ISP <-------- IAANA/ICAAN




Types Of IP Address
-------------------

1. Public IP Address ----> IP Address of my ISP
			myipaddress
			ipchicken.com
			ipcow.com

2. Private IP Address ---> IP Address of my own device
		windows --> ipconfig
		Linux ---> ifconfig
		UNIX ---> ifconfig

NAT ---> Network Address Translation
------------------------------------
It maps or translates our Local/Private IP Address to Public IP Address for proper communication

DHCP ---> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
=============================================
When ever we are connected to a router, firstly we are assign the IP Address to the device. DHCP is the only protocol which is enabled in the router and it provides our device so called IP Address
