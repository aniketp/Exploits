Ransomware:

Ransomware is a kind of malware which prevents users from accessing their data either by encrypting it or hiding it. Encryption can be done either by locking the files or the system manager.More modern ransomware types, also known as crypto-ransomware, encrypt certain file types on infected systems and forces users to pay the ransom through certain online payment methods to get a decrypt key.The payment is generally done through bitcoins to avoid revealing of indentity. Since bitcoins are not monitored by the central authority they can easily get away with the mischief.

How it gets into the system in the forst place?
Ransomwares are included in the system either by getting downloaded from the remote host or by user clicking the email link which are sent through the spam mails. It can also arrive as a payload when someone accessed or hacked into the target's system.

Once executed in the system, ransomware can either lock the computer screen, or, in the case of crypto-ransomware, encrypt all the files. In the first scenario, a full-screen image or notification is displayed on the infected system's screen, which prevents victims from using their system. This also shows the instructions on how users can pay for the ransom. The second type of ransomware prevents access to files to potentially critical or valuable files like their images, files and important documents.

One payment completion, the hackers send the decryption key to the people through which they can unlock their files.

How to prevent it?
Use Linux, because fuck windows. On the other hand, if you are using windows and don't want to switch to this cooler operating system, you can try to keep upgrading and fixing your system regularly. And as mentioned by our honourable Abhijeet sir, don't fall in the trap :P
