Introduction to IDS, IPS, FIREWALL, Honeypots

Firewall: A Network Security system that monitors and controls the traffic passing through it. Firewall basically works on Policies and Rules that are already set up into it. 



Firewall behaves as a barrier between the secure Internal Network and the outside world.

IDS – Intrusion Detection System

A Device or Software that monitors network or system activities for any unwanted activity that can harm or attempt to get into the company’s network 
•	IDS detects the Intrusion and generates alert that can be in form of Sound Beep, SMS, Email etc
•	IDS never stop the Intrusion but detection work is done.
•	IDS monitor both Inbound and Outbound Traffic.


IPS – Intrusion Prevention System

A System or software that prevents the Network or a system from the Intrusion that can harm to our network
•	IPS detects the intrusion and prevents it from getting enter into the Network of Company.
•	Dissimilar to IDS it stops the Intrusion on the way to Internal Network instead of just detecting it and showing alert.
•	IPS also monitors both Inbound and Outbound Traffic.




Honey Pot:
It is a trap that is designed in such a way that it can catch cyber criminals who used to make counteract attempt at unauthorized use of Information System.
Generally, Honeypots consists of Data that appears to be legitimate part of the site but actual it is isolated and being Monitored about the Hacker’s activities.
Two Types of Honeypots:


1.	Production Honeypots: 
These are Mid Level Honeypots deployed by Mid level Organisation as it is cheap in Price and easy to Monitor.

2.	Research Honeypots: 
These Honeypots are mostly used by Govt. Agencies for research purpose or national security so they deployed this at highly security areas and keeping on collecting techniques used by hackers and have new reaches on them. Huge collections of logs here have to be maintained.


#  Working Architecture of Firewall
Firewalls are of two types:
1.	Software Firewall
2.	Hardware  Firewall

Software Firewall: 
In this technology a firewall based application or software can be installed into a server and can be created as a barrier between user and end point.
OS=
Linux		: MOD SECURITY	= free - open source
Windows	: DOT DEFENDER - paid
Hardware Firewall:
This is a Hardware Firewall Sytem with Polcies and Rules, to which we kept between the ROUTER and End Devices, through which every packet from/to the network  will be filtered. It may consists of Antivirus, IDS, IDP, Firewall.utm

MOD SECURITY: 
Mod Security comes to picture in early 2008 when hackers are on the peak and defacing websites all over the world. This was era when there are many paid firewalls but there was no solution for the middle level organisations.
Mod Security came and gives a little hope to web site owners that they will protect from hackers.
Problems occur in starting phase:
1. Attack database was limited.
2. Open source but lack of funding.
OWASP TOP 10 Attack they made open. Call to Hackers.
•	OWASP share its Method with MOD to make them much updated


Installation Steps: Mod Security on Ubuntu
Step 1: $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security

Step 2: $ sudo a2enmod mod-security

Step 3: $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload

Working of Web Firewalls
Every Firewall works on two principal formats 
1.	White List and 
2.	Black List Filtration

1. White List : When we declare the owner must only login from a certain static IP as well as MAC address and username and password. Hence even the password got leaked no one can login the website unless he is not on the same IP and the MAC address.

2. Black List : It's the second way of securing the website hence it will be having a database of all the non sense attacks especially string based ( order by ), (union all select) etc etc etc.Hence any request carrying this kind of string from VISITOR will be get filtered by the blacklist and in response will block if match with any string from the list.


Configure Mod Security in Ubuntu After Installation :

Step 1: sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

After opening this file i.e 000-default.conf we have to change the IP address of the server or the website name whose traffic which we want to filter from mod security.

Step 2: Sudo service apache2 restart

Words getting detect:

union
select

Bypassing a Firewall:

Method 1 : Using mixture of Upper and Lower Case characters

union  -> UnIoN

select -> SeLeCt


Method 2: Using Inline Executable Comments

union ->  /*!union*/

select ->  /*!select*/
