Network Terminology II
======================
Types Of Network
----------------

1. PAN --> Personal Area Network ---> bluetooeh conectivity --> 1-10 m
2. LAN --> Local Area Network --> WiFi, Building, Lab, Campus ---> 10 -100 m
3. MAN --> Metro.. Area Network ---> CyberCity, Cyber Hub --> 100m -- 10 km
4. WAN --> Wide Area Network --> Earth se lekr mars tk, continents to continents ----> infinity



FTP
SMTP
HTTP
SSH
TELNET

Port ---> Gates of the device, from where my service enter and works
		1. Physical Port
		2. Virtual Port
65,555
Port number greater than 1200


Port number ---> they are the gate numbers which are assigned to my services
		1. Pre Defined
		2. Well known
		3. Dynamic Ports/ Register Ports


DNS --> Domain Name Server ----> It interchange IP address to domain name and domain name to IP Address and vise-versa

192.168.10.5

192--> 11000000
168--> 10101000
10-->  00001010
5 -->  00000101

		128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
		1 	1 	0	0	0	0	0	0
		1 	0	1 	0	1 	0	0	0
		0	0	0	0	1 	0	1 	0
		0 	0 	0 	0 	0 	1 	0 	1

192.168.10.5 ---> 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000101

www.google.com -----> DNS -----> 167.132.12.34

Proxy Services
--------------
It is a dummy server, which is used to spoof and hide my IP Address and shows someone else's IP Address
	kproxy.com
	ninjaproxy.com

	

VPN --> Virtual Provate Network
-------------------------------
It not only hides my IP Address but also encrypted the data.
Hello Baby ----> VPN ---> erqqo fcea ----> Send
They act same as that of my proxy servers, but they are little advance then the proxy.
	1. They hides my IP Address
	2. They encrypts the data
	3. They provide me the tunneling

1. Extension Based ---> Addon, extension, plugin --> Anonymox
2. Stand Alone ---> They are software based or hardware based proxy ---> HotSpot Shield ---> psiphon, spotflux, openVPN, proxpn
3. online services ---> we can use these services online without downloading them

OSI Model ---> Open System Interconnection Model
------------------------------------------------
ISO for the internet connection
This Model was not completely feassible.... Let's make this model as an ideal model..... Jitne bhi model aayenge vo is model k base pr hoyenge.

There are 7 layers in OSI model.
1. Physical Layer ---> Conversion and transport
2. Data Link Layer --> MAC addrss
3. Network Layer ---> IP address
4. Transport Layer ---> Route Of the MAP
5. Session Layer ---> Session Maintain
6. Presentation Layer --> How the data is being presented
7. Application Layer ---> What type will use what reources, mera data konsi service ko use krega



Web Technology
--------------
1. Domain Name
2. Hosting Place
3. Server
	--> Linux Based
	--> Microsoft Based

	--> Shared Hosting
	--> Dedicated Hosting
4. Database --> Arrangement for storing data in a tabular way --> rows & columns
5. Technology ---> Languages


Torrent---- How does torrent works
TCP/IP Model -----?
