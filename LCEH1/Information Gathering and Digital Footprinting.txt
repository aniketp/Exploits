Information Gathering and Digital Foot Printing
===============================================
5 Phases of hacking
-------------------
For just a simple hack and a well good and big hack, there are 5 phases which are needed to be followed for performing a successful hack.

	1. Information Gathering
	2. Scanning
	3. Gaining Access
	4. Maintaining Access
	5. Covering Tracks

Phase 1 and Phase 2 ---> Pre Exploitation
Phase 3 ---> Exploitation
Phase 4 and Phase 5 ---> Post Exploitation

The more information we get the more easy it will be in exploiting.

Phase 1
-------
		In information gathering we collect the information about the target. What does he do, where does he go, what do he eat, what do he like and dislike, what is the username the target is using, which profile he is using... etc etc....
		We craft a social engineering attack for exploiting the target.

Phase 2
-------
		In this phase we, as the attacker try to get the information about the services my target is using. For example, my target is using an FTP server in the office. So we try to scan that FTP server and then we gather what kind of FTP services he is using, company of FTP server etc etc..

Phase 3
-------
		Now it's the time for using that information to exploit the target. In this phase we hack into the system of the target and we fetch out the juicy data that the system is having. This phase is also known as the core hacking phase.

Phase 4
-------
		This phase is done after hacking. in other words, this phase is necessary for maintaining the hack that the attacker have performed. We always create a backdoor in this phase, so that the attacker can access the hacked system any time he wants to and can steal the information which is required by the attacker.

Phase 5
-------
		When every thing is done, the attacker needs to cover the traces of hacking. so that he can escape from the investigation part. And can roam freely.

Which reveals my target is what kind of person at all. This information will be used by the attacker as the plus point in terms os hacking.

Login Bypass
------------
When my windows is protected from windows login password, we need to elevate the password services.
There are two types of login bypass
	1. Offline Bypass
	----------------
			When the user is using the device and you ask it for couple of minutes and change the password without knowing the previous password.
			SAM  --> Security Account Manager

			Right Click on "My Computer"
			Click on "Manage"
			Click on "Local Users and Groups"
			Double Click on "Users"
			From there select the user of which you want to change the password
			Right click on the selected user
			Click on "Set Password"
			
	2. Online Bypass
